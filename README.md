# NodeJSSDK
This is the Node JS Developer SDK for DocHorizon.
The SDK offers multiple functions for accessing our API services within
your own application.  
&emsp;

## DocHorizon API Key
To fully utilize this SDK you will need to authenticate using a DocHorizon API key.
If you are interested in our services but do not have an API key yet, feel free to contact us [here](https://klippa.com/en/contact-en)

&emsp;

## Installation
install the SDK using npm.


```npm install @klippa/dochorizon-sdk```

or

```npm i @klippa/dochorizon-sdk```

&emsp;

## Usage
1. Authenticate using your api-key as follows:
   ```DocHorizon.authenticate({your-api-key})```
2. capture a document using the financial model (example):
   ```DocHorizon.financial.capture({your-document})```
3. If at any point you want to unauthenticate, use the following:
   ```DocHorizon.unauthenticate()```

&emsp;  
This SDK is organized into various services and can be accessed using the following syntax:
```DocHorizon.{service}```. To use a specific function from a service, call upon
that function using the following syntax: ```DocHorizon.{service}.{function}```.    
&emsp;  
For a basic overview of provided services within this SDK, refer to the following section. For a
